## Who are we?

Our aim is to promote and encourage the sport of archery within Oxfordshire, to provide opportunities for archers of all levels to access quality coaching, to help clubs develop, and to support and develop performance archery in the county.

We hold annual indoor and outdoor county championships, select and train teams to represent the county in inter-county and regional events and maintain records. As well as target championships, we also organise county championships in field and clout.

For those of you with an interest in trying archery as a sport you can find a list of archery clubs in Oxfordshire here. We recommend that you attend an archery beginner's course run by a local club. This is, in most cases, a prerequisite to joining an archery club.
